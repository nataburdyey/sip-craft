      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        At SipCraft, we believe that great taste doesn't always have to come
        with a buzz. Our team of beverage wizards has worked tirelessly to
        create unique and tantalizing drink recipes that will leave you
        refreshed, without the risk of a wild night out or any questionable
        dance moves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheers to flavor, creativity, and a whole lot of fun without the
        morning-after regrets. Let's toast to life, one delicious mocktail at a
        time!
      </p>
