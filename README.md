## SipCraft

This project is a `Single-Page Application` (SPA) built using `React` and `React Router`. It demonstrates how to set up routing and navigation in a React application using React Router. The project uses React Router version 6.11.2.

### Tech Stack
- `JavaScript`: The foundational programming language for creating responsive and interactive features.
- `React`: The powerful JavaScript library used to build the project: 
- - `useState`: The React hook used to manage state.
- `React Query`: Efficiently manages data fetching and API requests.
- `React Query Devtools`: Inspects and debugs React Query data and caching behavior.
- `React Router 6`: Handles routing and navigation within the React application.
- - `Outlet`: Used in parent route elements to render their child route elements.
- - `Link`: A component that lets the user navigate to another page by clicking or tapping on it.
- - `NavLink`: A special kind of <Link> that knows whether or not it is "active" or "pending".
- - `Navigate`: Changes the current location when it is rendered.
- - `Form`: A wrapper around a plain HTML form that emulates the browser for client side routing and data mutations.
- - `useRouteError`: This hook returns anything thrown during an action, loader, or rendering.
- - `useLoaderData`: This hook provides the value returned from your route loader.
- - `useNavigation`: This hook tells you everything you need to know about a page navigation to build pending navigation indicators and optimistic UI on data mutations. 
- - `action`: Called whenever the app sends a non-get submission ("post", "put", "patch", "delete") to your route.
- - `redirect`: Redirects to a specific route.
- `Axios`: Performs HTTP requests and handles API calls.
- `Styled Components`: Utilizes CSS-in-JS to style React components.
- `React Toastify`: Displays toast notifications in the React application.
- `TheCocktailDB API`: Utilizes the API to retrieve cocktail-related data.
